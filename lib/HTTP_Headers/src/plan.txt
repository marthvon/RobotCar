Step one add a Basic_HTTP_Header class using the Hashmap libraries for ESP32/82...
The hashmap is use in a function Factory that generated the class using client read as input
The classes also have their own hashmap used on member functions like has(String&), get(String&), set(String&, void*)

Step two add an advance HTTP Header that initialize classes like Authorization, Cookies, and etc. The classes have functionalities specific to it. 
For example, Authorization has two modes, the Basic and Digest.

Step three somehow integrate the basic and advanced http headers together wherein the user can easily switch between the two depending on what's required in their
project
